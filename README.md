## Hi, I'm Ben 👋
This is my personal github for contributions to open source projects. I have
been working in operating systems & security for over a decade and really
enjoy building secure performant systems. I have had the opportunity to work
on two microkernels in my career and two monolithic kernels and I am hoping
in 2026 to increase my open source contributions to projects related to Rust
and the Linux ecosystem.

I have a personal technical blog at [https://rsp.dev](https://rsp.dev) and you
can reach out to me over email at [ben@rsp.dev](mailto:ben@rsp.dev).
